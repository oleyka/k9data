# Place for k9 datasets and some stats

I am learning pandas and since there's so much interesting data on dogs that has never been properly analyzed, this sounds like an easy and fun project to try pandas on.

All datasets are (c) of their respective authors and I do not claim my part in any step of collecting/producing them. They are used here for educational purposes only. The OFFA does not allow the public reproduction of their data, therefore the health test reports dataset is outside the scope of this repo.
